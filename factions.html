                There are many Orders, Guilds and other organisations in Xentaria. They all have different duties and
                responsibilities in the world. The Guild System for example was created to give many traders and workers
                a fair and safe structure. There are ten official guilds in the world. If you want to join one, you need
                to pay for their services. In return you might get education from the best people in the guild,
                protection from thieves, or help with setting up your wares. You will also get a letter of affiliation
                that many customers put high value on. Joining a guilt is a safe, but costly matter and many people
                can’t keep it up to pay for their services. Others just think the guilds are a scam and try their luck
                on their own. But life without the protection of one of these powerful institutes can be incredibly hard
                and many merchants who try to make their own way fail.<br>
                Even though every guild has one domicile, you will find a facility for all of them in any major city.
                The seat of the mage guilt is in Dasdasien for example, but there are smaller, less prestigious colleges
                in Cascia, Aston, Eliasien and even Geddoz. The size of these facilities is highly dependent on the
                population, the necessities and the demand of the region. While the hunters guild has many branches in
                Karogon, there are very few ones in the Cascian Empire, because of the lack of hunting grounds. Some
                facilities are only populated by a single guild leader, others have docences of permanent employees who
                make sure that the customers are taken care of and that they regularly pay.<br>
                All guilds have one so-called master, who usually takes care of all the political affairs with the
                kingdoms or other royal leaders. They have many workers under them and the network of some of the bigger
                guilds can be quite difficult to keep track of.<br>
                In the following chapter a quick description of the guilds and some other organizations is given.

            </p>
            <h2>Trade Consortium (Merchants Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                What most people simply call the merchants guild, the people of Dornoth call the Trade Consortium. It is
                based in the desert city of Armedestan, where hundreds of people do their daily business every day. It
                is not the most prestigious of guilds, but the locals are proud of the business it brings to the city.
                Without it Armedestan would have little say in foreign affairs. The Trade Consortium basically sells
                everything that isn’t sold by any of the other guilds: Candles, black powder, oil, torches, baskets,
                barrels, food, horses, sleeping bags and other supplies the public needs. This guild is probably the
                most spread one in all of Xentaria and you will find one of their facilities in even small villages all
                around the world.

            <h3>Arcane College (Magic Guild)</h3>
            <p>
                Arcane college, magic guild, wizards emporium, all names for the same thing. Dasdasien is the seat of
                this reputable organisation where most wizards learn their craft. Hundreds of magic users learn how to
                do simple spells here. Most people are astounded by all the ghostly hands that float around the town
                when they enter it for the first time. All arising from young apprentices who try to learn their first
                cantrips. The college has a complicated educational system with many different teachers for each arcane
                school. Every student has to go through rigorous exams before getting the badge of a full grown wizard.
                The best of them might also be taught the fine art of crafting magic items, a rare and difficult skill
                that only few manage to perfect. There are also many classes for trade, to sell the items that are
                created here, and for court manners, because many kings request personal wizards as advisors.
