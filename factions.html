            <p>
                There are many Orders, Guilds and other organisations in Xentaria. They all have different duties and
                responsibilities in the world. The Guild System for example was created to give many traders and workers
                a fair and safe structure. There are ten official guilds in the world. If you want to join one, you need
                to pay for their services. In return you might get education from the best people in the guild,
                protection from thieves, or help with setting up your wares. You will also get a letter of affiliation
                that many customers put high value on. Joining a guilt is a safe, but costly matter and many people
                can’t keep it up to pay for their services. Others just think the guilds are a scam and try their luck
                on their own. But life without the protection of one of these powerful institutes can be incredibly hard
                and many merchants who try to make their own way fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though every guild has one domicile, you will find a facility for all of them in any major city.
                The seat of the mage guilt is in Dasdasien for example, but there are smaller, less prestigious colleges
                in Cascia, Aston, Eliasien and even Geddoz. The size of these facilities is highly dependent on the
                population, the necessities and the demand of the region. While the hunters guild has many branches in
                Karogon, there are very few ones in the Cascian Empire, because of the lack of hunting grounds. Some
                facilities are only populated by a single guild leader, others have docences of permanent employees who
                make sure that the customers are taken care of and that they regularly pay.
            </p>
            <p>
                All guilds have one so-called master, who usually takes care of all the political affairs with the
                kingdoms or other royal leaders. They have many workers under them and the network of some of the bigger
                guilds can be quite difficult to keep track of.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following chapter a quick description of the guilds and some other organizations is given.

            </p>
            <h2 id="merchants-guild">Trade Consortium (Merchants Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                What most people simply call the merchants guild, the people of Dornoth call the Trade Consortium. It is
                based in the desert city of Armedestan, where hundreds of people do their daily business every day. It
                is not the most prestigious of guilds, but the locals are proud of the business it brings to the city.
                Without it Armedestan would have little say in foreign affairs. The Trade Consortium basically sells
                everything that isn’t sold by any of the other guilds: Candles, black powder, oil, torches, baskets,
                barrels, food, horses, sleeping bags and other supplies the public needs. This guild is probably the
                most spread one in all of Xentaria and you will find one of their facilities in even small villages all
                around the world.

            </p>
            <h2 id="magic-guild">Arcane College (Magic Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                Arcane college, magic guild, wizards emporium, all names for the same thing. Dasdasien is the seat of
                this reputable organisation where most wizards learn their craft. Hundreds of magic users memorise the
                knowledge of how to do simple spells here. Most people are astounded by all the ghostly hands that float
                around the town when they enter it for the first time. All arising from young apprentices who try to
                learn their first cantrips. The college has a complicated educational system with many different
                teachers for each arcane school. Every student has to go through rigorous exams before getting the badge
                of a full grown wizard. The best of them might also be taught the fine art of crafting magic items, a
                rare and difficult skill that only few manage to perfect. There are also many classes for trade, to sell
                the items that are created here, and for court manners, because many kings request personal wizards as
                advisors.
            </p>
            <h2 id="mercenary-guild">The Iron Company (Mercenary Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                No place in the world creates tougher, faster, smarter and more experienced warriors then the Iron
                Company. Or at least that is what they will tell you in Geddoz, the seat of the guild. The training each
                newcomer has to go through is rough. From sparing, to real arena fighting, up to real world assignments,
                all is necessary to be able to get the Iron badge, that makes you an official member of the guilt. Since
                the seat is in Orc territory, most mercenaries here are of the tougher races and it is hard for a Human
                or an Elf to find success. But the Company has facilities in every capital and in many militarily
                important towns. To hire the soldiers of the guilt you need to spend quite some money. But they are well
                worth it and the strongest among them are considered the best warriors in all of Xentaria.
            </p>
            <h2 id="thieves-guild">The Mesmien Brotherhood (Thieves Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                The Thieves Guild is not an official guild at all, but everyone knows that she exists. It has its own
                language (Thieves’ Cant), its own leaders and its own structure. No one outside of the Guild knows where
                its headquarters are, or if there is such a thing. And even the ones who have good connections with the
                Brotherhood are usually kept in darkness until they have proven themselves. However, in the more
                dangerous and less lawfully regulated places in the world, like Dornoth, Iseria or the Rainbow Islands
                the Guild has a strong presence. Shop owners usually have to pay fees to not get robbed blind, but if
                they do so, they get valuable protection. Because people from this association don’t like competition.
                Anyone who is not a member of the Guild better needs to make sure that he doesn’t steal from one under
                their protection, or they might never rob anyone again. The name, Mesmien Brotherhood, comes from the
                founder, Tobias Mesmien. He was the most famous rogue ever known, who robbed the crown of four kings
                just to prove a point. This was nearly two hundred years ago, but his tale is still the stuff of
                legends.

            </p>
            <h2 id="smiths-guild">The Order of Steel (Smiths Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                In the city of Cascia, the Order of Steel resides. This famous school teaches anyone who is willing to
                learn how to create the best armor, weapons, and tools. Every country, institution and company buys from
                the Smiths’ Guild, if they can afford it. While the Guilds are supposed to be politically neutral, the
                Cascian Empire has its grasp on this Order in particular. Having access to the finest weaponry
                production gives them military prowess that other kingdoms can’t keep up with. But the facility in
                Cascia is not the only one. Many merchants, smiths and artisans travel the world, or set up their shops
                in towns and cities. Geddoz itself has the second largest branch of the Smith’s Guild, mostly because of
                the high demand for all the warriors of the Iron Company.
            </p>
            <h2 id="hunters-guild">The Hunters Lodge (Hunters Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                If you join the Hunters Lodge you can learn how to survive in the wild. They teach you tracking skills,
                animal skinning techniques, stealthy approaches and other useful abilities that you might need when you
                are looking for a way to survive the icy tundras of Iseria, or the harsh barren lands of Karogon. The
                Guild is based in Everwinter, with many facilities stretched across the kingdoms. They mostly reside in
                places near forests, or where there is actually game to kill. If you are ever in need of a tracker, a
                navigator or a hunter, you can hire trained professionals here any time. The Dwarves of Tarork have
                their own Hunters Guild which is technically a part of the Lodge, but only Dwarves can become members.
                They learn how to roam the ‘Way of the Depths’ and look for treasures and mining ores. These are quite
                different skills then you would need on the surface.

            </p>
            <h2 id="masons-guild">Order of the Stone (Masons Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                The Masons Guild is based in Tarork. The Dwarves being incredibly proud of their stonework value this
                profession probably above all others. Here the delicate skill of creating tunnels, statues and buildings
                that will last centuries is being taught. However, Dwarves are really protective of their craft and you
                won’t find many other races among them. Maybe a Human or an Elf if they have the coin to afford it. You
                can hire a mason for your construction work though and the workers of the Guild are happy to point out
                what others did wrong in their craft. Some of the finest buildings in the world have been crafted by the
                Order, like the Temple of the Dead in Cascia, or the Statue of Gexos in Everwinter. There are facilities
                nearly everywhere in the world, except maybe for Karogon.
            </p>
            <h2 id="leatherworkers-guild">The Buff Collective (Leatherworkers Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                Seated in Aston, in the Vultai Kingdom, the Buff Collective produces some of the finest armor, shoes and
                coats you will find. Having close ties with the Hunters Lodge, the Guild can provide you with a full
                leather outfit in a short time. You can learn how to stitch, burnish, dye and skive your products and
                sell them as well. The Guild is probably the second most common one after the Traders Guild and there
                isn’t a town that doesn’t at least have a store or two.

            </p>
            <h2 id="alchemist-guild">The Circle of Healing (Alchemist Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                Want to brew a love potion, cure yourself of the nasty herpes you’ve been struggling with or find some
                remedies against combat wounds? All that and more can be accomplished by, or learned from the Alchemist
                Guild. Being seated in Cascia, it lies at the center of the Empire and many people rely on the hundreds
                of tinctures that are created here every day. Also a very wide spread Guild, the Circle of Healing's
                reputation and reliability varies quite a bit. While in the richer kingdoms it seems more like a science
                to figure out the best combination and concentrations to make remedies, in some of the poorer areas it
                sometimes comes close to voodoo. The effectiveness of these different styles of alchemy can be debated,
                but many people vow to its powers and you will find followers of the craft anywhere.
            </p>
            <h2 id="jewelers-guild">The Gem Emporium (Jewelers Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                The only thing Dwarves like more than their stonework is their money. The Jewelers Guild is based in
                Tarork, where gems are directly minded from within the ‘Way of the Depths’ and processed further. After
                cleaning and evaluation, they are burnished and weighed to be ready for the market. The appraisal skills
                of a member of the Jewelers Guild is legendary. Some can tell the authenticity of a gem from just a
                single glance. Similarly to the Order of the Stone, the Dwarves are very protective of this skill and
                only few foreigners are allowed into the Guild. There are however a wide amount of facilities scattered
                around the world, mostly in the protective environment of a city though.
            </p>
            <h2 id="crafts-guild">The Artisanry Collective (Crafts Guild)</h2>
            <p>
                If you are in need to build a bridge, create some weaponry or construct some furniture you need to talk
                to the Crafts Guild. It is based in Cascia and is responsible for some of the most advanced machinery
                that you can see there. The drawbridge near the capital was created by the finest artisans from the
                Collective and it is considered one of its kind. Most ships of the Cascian Armada were also created by
                the Guild. While there are many facilities in the world, none are as famous, or produce as impressive of
                objects, as the ones in Cascia. Due to the nature of the art, the Masons Guild and the Crafts Guild
                often have to work together to finish projects, a fact that has led to many issues between the Empire
                and Tarork.
            </p>
            <h2 id="royal-convention">The Royal Convention</h2>
            <p>
                The royal convention is a yearly event that has existed for nearly four centuries. Here the leaders of
                the five kingdoms meet in one of the capitals to discuss foreign politics and treaties. Established
                after the end of the ‘underground wars’, the goal of the convention was to establish peace among the
                kingdoms and in the broadest sense it has succeeded at that, even though there had been many
                fall-backs.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the event is supposed to be a royal and honoroble meeting, in reality there is more
                bickering and
                backstabbing here then on a Bugbears wedding. Every leader usually tries to get as many advantages for
                his own nation as possible and will gladly betray his neighbour for more trade contracts or military
                access. While officially there are only five rulers part of the convention, oftentimes more important
                personnel attend. Like the Dwarves from Tarork, or important businessmen from Madara. While a political
                slugfest, the public usually enjoys this event and the city who hosts it is usually a big tourist
                attraction for the week that it lasts. It is very common that the royal leaders bring excotic creatures
                or artists from their kingdoms to show off their abilities and skills. A jousting tournament also
                accompanies the royal convention and the whole event feels like a big festival that everyone can take
                part in.
