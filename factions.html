        <h1>The Factions of Xentaria</h1>
        <p>
            There are many Orders, Guilds and other organisations in Xentaria. They all have different duties and
            responsibilities in the world. The Guild System for example was created to give many traders and workers a
            fair and safe structure. There are ten official guilds in the world. If you want to join one, you need to
            pay for their services. In return you might get education from the best people in the guild, protection from
            thieves, or help with setting up your wares. You will also get a letter of affiliation that many customers
            put high value on. Joining a guilt is a safe, but costly matter and many people can’t keep it up to pay for
            their services. Others just think the guilds are a scam and try their luck on their own. But life without
            the protection of one of these powerful institutes can be incredibly hard and many merchants who try to make
            their own way fail.
            Even though every guild has one domicile, you will find a facility for all of them in any major city. The
            seat of the mage guilt is in Dasdasien for example, but there are smaller, less prestigious colleges in
            Cascia, Aston, Eliasien and even Geddoz. The size of these facilities is highly dependent on the population,
            the necessities and the demand of the region. While the hunters guild has many branches in Karogon, there
            are very few ones in the Cascian Empire, because of the lack of hunting grounds. Some facilities are only
            populated by a single guild leader, others have docences of permanent employees who make sure that the
            customers are taken care of and that they regularly pay.
            All guilds have one so-called master, who usually takes care of all the political affairs with the kingdoms
            or other royal leaders. They have many workers under them and the network of some of the bigger guilds can
            be quite difficult to keep track of.
            In the following chapter a quick description of the guilds and some other organizations is given.

            <h3>TRADE CONSORTIUM (MERCHANTS GUILD):</h2>
                <p>
                    What most people simply call the merchants guild, the people of Dornoth call the Trade Consortium.
                    It is based in the desert city of Armedestan, where hundreds of people do their daily business every
                    day. It is not the most prestigious of guilds, but the locals are proud of the business it brings to
                    the city. Without it Armedestan would have little say in foreign affairs. The Trade Consortium
                    basically sells everything that isn’t sold by any of the other guilds: Candles, black powder, oil,
                    torches, baskets, barrels, food, horses, sleeping bags and other supplies the public needs. This
                    guild is probably the most spread one in all of Xentaria and you will find one of their facilities
                    in even small villages all around the world.
