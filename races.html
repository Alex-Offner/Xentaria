                There are many different races living in Xentaria. If not otherwise stated, they follow the basic rules
                and descriptions of the books. You can have a look at them here:
                <br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races" target="_blank">D&D Beyond Races</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Because of the nature of the world however, many races have different origins, relationships to other
                species or sometimes even different abilities. Some are rarer than others and less likely to be
                travelers. Others need consideration and consultation with the Dungeon Master. If not otherwise stated,
                all races listed here are natural to this world and don’t necessarily come from different realms as may
                be mentioned in the official rules. Kalashtar, Gith, Simic Hybrid, Verdan and Locathah are not part of
                this world and therefore not playable. The following pages will give a short description of the races,
                their place in the world and their most likely relationship to others.
            </p>
            <h3>Humans</h3>
            <p>
                Humans are probably the most common race in Xentaria. Their incredible ability to adapt to most climates
                makes them almost appear everywhere, except maybe in the deep oceans or the very high mountains. The
                most common place for humans to come from in Xentaria are either the Cascian Empire, Vultai or Iseria,
                but the continent of Madara or Dornoth are nearly equally as likely. Their variety in character and
                personality makes them work in every field.
            </p>
            <h3>Dwarves</h3>
            <p>
                Dwarves, while never seen in Karogon and rarely seen in Dornoth populate most of the world as well. They
                tend to be tough and brave and love the deep roads. Most dwarves value loyalty very highly and have good
                memories for those who break their trust. The capital of their people is Tarork and it is connected to
                the ‘Way of the Depths’. While it is mostly in ruins, many dwarves still adventure down into this
                gigantic tunnel network to look for long lost cities and treasure. Because the lust for riches and gold
                is what unites all of the little people.
                Dwarves hate Orcs and Genasi, so much so that some of them will challenge them to a duel if seen. While
                there are loose peace treaties between the Orc tribes of Geddoz and Tarork, they will only go so far as
                to prevent all out open war and it is not rare to see fighting between them. Especially if Orcs or
                Genasi venture into the ‘Way of the Depths’.
