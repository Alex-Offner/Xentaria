            <p>
                Religion and the gods play a major role in the world of Xentaria. One of the core principles of this
                world is duality which you will find in many faiths, symbolisms or even in the landscape itself. Fire
                and ice, light and dark, life and death - all concepts that influence the word greatly. This can also be
                seen in the gods themselves, especially in the old gods.
            </p>
            <h2>The Old Gods</h2>
            <p>
                The old gods were the only gods before the age of heroes. Nearly every race has their own and in most
                cases there are only two for each species. Usually each race has a male and female god who have opposing
                personalities, attributes and looks. They are worshipped by most members of their races, or at least
                accepted as the divine powers that protect the mortals here on Xentaria. Rarely is it seen that a member
                of another race worships an old god they don’t belong to. They also usually resemble the looks of the
                race they are worshiped by. Even today they still get a lot of respect from people, but their status has
                definitely declined. Each race handles their worship differently as well. While Humans for example
                believe that their gods are divine beings in a realm far away who watch over the world through their
                clerics and other servants, the Aarakocra think of the gods as beings who possess members of their
                tribes and therefore walk among the living until their mortal bodies die and they become reincarnated.
                It is very common for clerics or religious people to worship both gods of their race at the same time,
                or to switch between them depending on situation and necessity. They might be drawn to a certain aspect
                of a god more than to others, but the dualistic nature of the world makes it very easy to pray to
                multiple deities.

                Even the most educated of religious researchers don’t know about all the old gods of each race and their
                many symbolisms, rites and customs. However a short list of the old gods of the most far reaching races
                can be seen here.

            <h3>Humans</h3>
            <p>
                It is believed that the Human gods live in a far realm and watch over their people through clerics
                and priests. They don’t always tend to the matters of the mortal realm, but that is only because of
                their incredible responsibility to watch over other worlds and beings. Someone who keeps to their
                faith and truly devotes themselves to their god will always get help and answers. It just might take
                longer than you hoped for.

                <br>
                <b><u>Xestus</u></b> is the male god of the human pantheon. He is generally depicted as a pale thin
                person with
                bull-like horns and grey skin. He wears light silky robes that change their appearance and color
                constantly. In some art he also carries a whip. Xestus represents the ever adaptive and changing
                nature of Humans. People pray to him if they want to improve their lives, adapt to new situations or
                hope for change. He is considered a neutral god who will do whatever it takes to protect his
                disciples. The symbol used by most of his followers is a golden grinning mask.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b><u>Cugtia</u></b> is the female god of the human pantheon. She is usually depicted as a proud warrior
                with a
                hammer and heavy armor. She has golden wings and wears a white hood. She is considered to be stoic,
                emotionless and powerful. Knowledge and wisdom are her key attributes which is why she is often
                prayed to by wizards or historians. People who believe that there is one truth out there for
                everything in life are automatically drawn to her. As she is considered the opposite of Xestus,
                people tend to pray to her to keep things as they are. The rich and happy people thank her for her
                help and for keeping them safe. A hammer or a sun are most often used as symbols to depict or
                worship her.

            <h2>The Third Age: The Age of Revenge</h2>
            <p>
                It was the dragons who were the first to show real resistance in the year 1852. These mighty creatures
                initially appeared in the first age, but had purposefully stayed hidden and out of sight for most of the
                second age. In the chaos of another never-ending battle, they suddenly emerged from the ground, the
                oceans, the lakes, and the mountains, followed by armies of humanoid lizards, which later became known
                as the Dragonborn. They attacked both elementals and demons alike with such fierceness that for the
                first time in centuries the war between ice and fire was halted and shifted towards these mighty worms.
                Historians believe that the following ‘three party war’, as it is called today, was what gave the lesser
                races the opportunity to fight back. This, and their pact with the dragons. Thirteen heroes from
                different races emerged all over the world. These thirteen heroes became stronger and stronger, fighting
                initially in smaller groups, but soon grew to leading armies of their races against the hordes of demons
                and elementals. These heroes, or as they later were called ‘the new gods’, made pacts with the mightiest
                of the dragons. They started riding them into battles and slowly but surely drove their enemies back -
                the demons to the south, and the elementals to the north. Gaining ground, the leader of the dragons,
                Mextragon, opened a gate to the Feywild with the help of the heroes to allow more dragons to come into
                this world to help fight. Iseria soon appeared to be defeated and retreated far into the north, so the
                focus of the fight shifted to the south and to Dornoth. In ‘the battle of the desert’ the heroes managed
                to defeat the demon lord and ban him from this world. In the meanwhile, however, Iseria managed to steal
                herself through the portal to the Feywild and started to corrupt it with her dark icy magic, an event
                later known as ‘the fission’. The portal to the fairy world collapsed and trapped the demigoddess there,
                but not without first creating considerable damage to all the creatures connected to the Feywild. The
                dragons lost their ability to cast their supernatural magic and became shadows of what they used to be.
                Some hid back in the mountains and lakes of the world, while others became angry at their loss of power
                and started to blame the mortals. The elves lost their connection as well. While their lives previously
                spanned for many hundreds of years, now they began to develop a strange illness that drove them mad once
                they reached 150 years of age. This disease was later called the ‘elven lunacy’. But the war was over;
                the demigods were defeated and the heroes emerged victorious. And so began the fourth age.

            <h2>The Fourth Age: The Age of Heroes</h2>
            <p>
                People say the year 2599 was the beginning of the age of heroes. With the end of the long war and the
                disappearance of most of the dragons the armies of dragonborn were shattered and leaderless. All other
                races that fought in the wars, like Elves, Dwarves and Humans were also deeply hurt and needed to
                rebuild. The century-long influence of the demons and elementals in this world however left their mark.
                In the south a mixed race of Humans and demons emerged, called the Tieflings. In the north, elemental
                humanoids called the Genasi were the reminders of the wars. The Orcs, no longer enslaved by Iseria,
                shook free of their former masters and found a new home in the north east, in a country named Karagon.
                They never truly recovered from this influence though and so Orcs (and to a lesser degree Half-orcs) are
                still heavily affected by the element of water or ice. The Dwarves, who had been almost completely
                driven out of their ‘Way of the Depths’, tried to rebuild the underground cities but the damage was
                done. Elementals and other wild and magical creatures had infested the deep roads and made it impossible
                to reconquer the underground. The thirteen heroes were celebrated from there on out as the saviours of
                the world and became risen gods in the following centuries after their deaths. They were called the new
                gods, each embodying certain abilities and traits. The world was divided into five kingdoms: Dornoth,
                the Cascian Empire, Karogon, Vultai and Iseria. The fourth age is ongoing - no historian has made any
                claims that the age is over or that a new age is in sight.
