                Religion and the gods play a major role in the world of Xentaria. One of the core principles of this
                word is
                duality which you will find in many worships, symbolisms or even in the landscape itself. Fire and ice,
                light and dark, life and death. All concepts that influence the word greatly. This can also be seen in
                the
                gods themselves, especially in the old gods.

                    It is believed that the human gods live in a far realm and watch over their people through clerics
                    and priests. They donâ€™t always tend to the matters of the mortal realm, but that is only because of
                    their incredible responsibility to watch over other words and beings. Someone who keeps to their
                    faith and truly devoted themselves to their god will always get help and answers. It just might take
                    longer than you hoped for.

                    <b><u>Xestus</u></b> is the male god of the human pantheon. He is generally resembled as a pale thin
                    person with bull-like horns and grey skin. He wears light silky robes that change their appearance
                    and color
                    constantly. In some art he also carries a whip. Xestus represents the ever adaptive and changing
                    nature of humans. People pray to him if they want to improve their lives, adapt to new situations or
                    hope for change. He is considered a neutral god who will do whatever it takes to protect his
                    disciples. The symbol used by most of his followers is a golden grinning mask.

                    <b><u>Cugtia</u></b> is the female god of the human pantheon. She is usually depicted as a proud
                    warrior
                    with a
                    hammer and heavy armor. She has golden wings and wears a white hood. She is considered to be stoic,
                    emotionless and powerful. Knowledge and wisdom are her key attributes which is why she is often
                    prayed to be wizards or historians. People who believe that there is one truth out there for
                    everything in life are automatically drawn to her. As she is considered the opposite of Xestus,
                    people tend to hope for her to keep things as they are. The rich and happy people thank her for her
                    help and for keeping them safe. A hammer or a sun are most often used as symbols to depict or
                    worship her.
