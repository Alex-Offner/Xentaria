            <h2>The First Age: The Age of Friendship</h2>
            <p>
                Each race has their own legends on how Xentaria was created; how their gods were the ones that shaped
                the continents and formed the oceans, rivers and mountains. Truth is, no one really knows how it came
                into existence, but most historians agree on one thing: it started around 3283 years ago; a time that is
                considered the year 0 by most calendars. The dominant species during these times were Humans, Dwarves,
                Orcs, Aarakocra, and the Yuan-ti who seemed to adapt best to the mountain ranges, rivers, and forests
                the world provided back then. Since written texts in this era are as rare as a pretty goblin, not much
                is known about the history, culture and civilisation. The first major historical event, however, was the
                opening of the gates between the Xentarian plane and the Feywild, which is estimated to have taken place
                in the year 650. No one knows how it happend, but within a century hundreds of magical, mythical
                creatures arrived in Xentaria. Centaurs, fairies, dragons and the Elves started roaming the land and
                changing the distribution of power within the world. The Dwarves seemed to get along well with the new
                elvish arrivals and bonds of friendship were formed. In the following years, a big jump in magical,
                technological, and cultural development took place. All of that, however, was halted by the arrival of
                demons and elementals at the beginning of the second age.

            <h2>The Second Age: The Age of Ice and Fire</h2>
            <p>
                The arrival of two mighty demigods in the year 1213 changed the world forever and started the ‘wars of
                ice and fire’ that would last for over a millennium. Dornoth, a demon lord from the deepest depths of
                the Abyss, and Iseria, the frozen genie of the elemental plane, chose this world as their new
                battleground. They raised armies of demons and elementals and fought for domination without any concern
                for the rest of the species living in this world. The mostly peaceful world was hit hard and unaware.
                Weaker races like Gnomes, Halflings, and Firbolgs were nearly wiped out immediately. The Dwarves started
                building tunnels and cities underground to escape the battles of fire and ice. Some of the Elves joined
                them while others fled to the western continent of Madara, where the fighting wasn’t as fierce. The
                Aarakocra hid deep in the eastern mountains, while the Yuan-ti tried to keep safe in their jungle
                temples. Only the Orcs and the Humans stayed on the open surface. The demon lord Dornoth offered power
                and riches to many Humans in exchange for their services and many accepted this offer. Those who didn’t
                were killed or enslaved. The Orcs on the other hand showed resistance, but were quickly captured and
                indoctrinated by the mighty demigoddess Iseria and were used as a tool for her war against the demons.
                During the next centuries war dominated Xentaria. The Dwarves, safe from the initial fighting, started
                to build what today is known as the ‘Way of the Depths’, a gigantic tunnel system that ranged through
                the whole world and even crossed continents. But when the demigods found out about their intricate
                underground system, they, too, wanted to use it for their troop movement. Iseria sent most of her troops
                into the underground cities of the dwarves, who now had to fight a terrible battle they never wanted to
                fight. Many, if not most, of the cities were lost and routes were destroyed, never to be rebuilt.

                The world was split into two halves: the icy north, infested by elementals and Orcs, and the fiery
                south, captured by demons and Humans. The middle of Xentaria became home to endless violence and
                battles... at least until the beginning of the third age.

            <h2>The Third Age: The Age of Revenge</h2>
            <p>
                It was the dragons who were the first to show real resistance in the year 1852. These mighty creatures
                initially appeared in the first age, but had purposefully stayed hidden and out of sight for most of the
                second age. In the chaos of another never-ending battle, they suddenly emerged from the ground, the
                oceans, the lakes, and the mountains, followed by armies of humanoid lizards, which later became known
                as the Dragonborn. They attacked both elementals and demons alike with such fierceness that for the
                first time in centuries the war between ice and fire was halted and shifted towards these mighty worms.
                Historians believe that the following ‘three party war’, as it is called today, was what gave the lesser
                races the opportunity to fight back. This, and their pact with the dragons. Thirteen heroes from
                different races emerged all over the world. These thirteen heroes became stronger and stronger, fighting
                initially in smaller groups, but soon grew to leading armies of their races against the hordes of demons
                and elementals. These heroes, or as they later were called ‘the new gods’, made pacts with the mightiest
                of the dragons. They started riding them into battles and slowly but surely drove their enemies back -
                the demons to the south, and the elementals to the north. Gaining ground, the leader of the dragons,
                Mextragon, opened a gate to the Feywild with the help of the heroes to allow more dragons to come into
                this world to help fight. Iseria soon appeared to be defeated and retreated far into the north, so the
                focus of the fight shifted to the south and to Dornoth. In ‘the battle of the desert’ the heroes managed
                to defeat the demon lord and ban him from this world. In the meanwhile, however, Iseria managed to steal
                herself through the portal to the Feywild and started to corrupt it with her dark icy magic, an event
                later known as ‘the fission’. The portal to the fairy world collapsed and trapped the demigoddess there,
                but not without first creating considerable damage to all the creatures connected to the Feywild. The
                dragons lost their ability to cast their supernatural magic and became shadows of what they used to be.
                Some hid back in the mountains and lakes of the world, while others became angry at their loss of power
                and started to blame the mortals. The elves lost their connection as well. While their lives previously
                spanned for many hundreds of years, now they began to develop a strange illness that drove them mad once
                they reached 150 years of age. This disease was later called the ‘elven lunacy’. But the war was over;
                the demigods were defeated and the heroes emerged victorious. And so began the fourth age.

            <h2>The Fourth Age: The Age of Heroes</h2>
            <p>
                People say the year 2599 was the beginning of the age of heroes. With the end of the long war and the
                disappearance of most of the dragons the armies of dragonborn were shattered and leaderless. All other
                races that fought in the wars, like Elves, Dwarves and Humans were also deeply hurt and needed to
                rebuild. The century-long influence of the demons and elementals in this world however left their mark.
                In the south a mixed race of Humans and demons emerged, called the Tieflings. In the north, elemental
                humanoids called the Genasi were the reminders of the wars. The Orcs, no longer enslaved by Iseria,
                shook free of their former masters and found a new home in the north east, in a country named Karagon.
                They never truly recovered from this influence though and so Orcs (and to a lesser degree Half-orcs) are
                still heavily affected by the element of water or ice. The Dwarves, who had been almost completely
                driven out of their ‘Way of the Depths’, tried to rebuild the underground cities but the damage was
                done. Elementals and other wild and magical creatures had infested the deep roads and made it impossible
                to reconquer the underground. The thirteen heroes were celebrated from there on out as the saviours of
                the world and became risen gods in the following centuries after their deaths. They were called the new
                gods, each embodying certain abilities and traits. The world was divided into five kingdoms: Dornoth,
                the Cascian Empire, Karogon, Vultai and Iseria. The fourth age is ongoing - no historian has made any
                claims that the age is over or that a new age is in sight.
