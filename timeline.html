            <h2>THE FIRST AGE: THE AGE OF FRIENDSHIP</h2>
            <p>
                Each race has their own legends on how Xentaria was created. How their gods were the ones that shaped
                the continents and formed the rivers and mountains. Truth is no one really knows how it came into
                existence, but most historians agree on one thing: it started around 3283 years ago; a time that is
                considered the year 0 by most calendars. The dominant species during these times were humans, dwarves,
                orcs, aarakocra and the yuan-ti’s who seemed to adept best to the mountain ranges, rivers and forest the
                word provided back then. Since written texts in this era are as rare as a pretty goblin, not much is
                known about the history, culture and civilisation. The first major historical event however was the
                opening of gates between the Xentarian plane and the Feywild which is estimated to have taken place in
                the year 650.. No one knows how it happend, but within a century hundreds of magical, mythical creatures
                arrived in the world. Centaurs, fairies, dragons and the elves started roaming the land and changing the
                distribution of power within the world. The dwarves seemed to get along well with the new elvish
                arrivals and bonds of friendship were formed. In these following years a big jump in magical,
                technological and cultural development seemed to happen. But all of that was halted by the arrival of
                demons and elementals and the beginning of the second age.

            <h2>THE FIRST AGE: THE AGE OF FRIENDSHIP</h2>
            <p>
                The arrival of two mighty demigods in the year 1213 seemed to change the world forever and started the
                ‘wars of ice and fire’ that would last for over a millennium. Dornoth, a demon lord from the deepest
                depths of the nine hells and Iseria, the frozen genie of the elemental plane chose this world as their
                new battle map. They raised armies of demons and elementals and fought for domination, without any
                concern for the species living in this world. The mostly peaceful world was hit hard and unaware. Weaker
                races like gnomes, halflings and firbolgs were nearly wiped out immediately. The dwarves started
                building tunnels and cities underground to escape the battles of fire and ice. Some of the elves joined
                them, others fled to the western continent of Madara, where the fighting wasn’t as fierce. The aarakocra
                hid deep in the eastern mountains, while the yuan-ti tried to keep safe in their jungle temples. Only
                the orcs and the humans stayed on the open surface. The demon lord Dornoth offered power and riches to
                the humans in exchange for their services and many accepted this offer, while those who didn’t were
                killed or enslaved. The orcs on the other hand showed resistance, but were quickly captured and
                indoctrinated by the mighty demigoddess Iseria and were used as a tool for her war against the demons.
                During the next centuries war dominated Xentaria. The dwarves, safe from the initial fighting, started
                to build what today is known as the ‘Way of the Depths’, a gigantic tunnel system that ranged through
                the whole world and even crossed continents. But when the demigods found out about their intricate
                underground system they wanted to use it for their troop movement, too. Especially Iseria sent most of
                her troops in the underground cities of the dwarves who had to fight a terrible battle now underground.
                Many if not most of the cities were lost and routes got destroyed, never to be rebuilt.
                The world got split into two halves: the icy north, infested by elementals and orcs and the fiery south,
                captured by demons and humans. The middle of Xentaria was the home of endless violence and battles. At
                least until the beginning of the third age.

            <h2>THE THIRD AGE: THE AGE OF REVENGE</h2>
            <p>
                It was the dragons that were the first to show real resistance in the year 1852. These mighty creatures
                who appeared in the first age and stayed hidden and out of sight for most of the second age emerged out
                of the ground, the oceans, the lakes and the mountains. Followed by armies of humanoid lizards which
                later become known as dragonborn. Without making a difference between elemental or demon they attacked
                with such fierceness that for the first time in centuries the war between ice and fire was halted and
                shifted towards these mighty worms. Historians believe that the following ‘three party war’ as it is
                called today, was what gave the lesser races the opportunity to fight back. This and their pact with the
                dragons. Thirteen heroes emerged from different races all over the world. Dwarves, elves, humans,
                yuan-ti, aarakocra and others. These thirteen heroes seemed to become stronger and stronger, fighting
                first by themselves in smaller groups but soon leading armies of their races against the hordes of
                demons and elementals. These heroes, or as they later were called ‘the new gods’, made pacts with the
                mightiest of the dragons. They started riding them into battles and slowly and surely they drove their
                enemies back. The demons to the south, the elementals to the north. Gaining ground, the leader of the
                dragons, Mextragon, opened a gate to the Feywild with the help of the heroes to allow more dragons to
                come into this world to help fight. Iseria seemed to be beaten and retreated far into the north, so the
                focus of the fight shifted to the south and to Dornoth. In ‘the battle of the desert’ the heroes managed
                to defeat the demon lord and ban him from this world. But in the meanwhile Iseria stole herself through
                the portal to the Feywild and started to corrupt it with her dark icy magic, an event later known as
                ‘the fission’. The portal to the fairy world collapsed and trapped the demigoddess there, but not
                without creating considerable damage to all the creatures connected to the Feywild. The dragons seemed
                to lose their ability to caste their overnatural magic and became only shadows of what they used to be.
                Some hid back in the mountains and lakes of the world, others got angry at their loss of power and
                started to blame the mortals. The elves lost their connection as well. While before they could live for
                up to many hundred years, now they seem to start to develop a strange illness that drives them mad when
                they reach 150 years of age. This disease was later called the ‘elven lunacy’. But the war was over. The
                demigods have been defeated and the heroes were victorious. And so began the fourth age.

            <h2>THE FOURTH AGE: THE AGE OF HEROES</h2>
            <p>
                People say the year 2599 was the beginning of the age of heroes. With the end of the long war and the
                disappearance of most of the dragons the armies of dragonborn were shattered and leaderless. All other
                races that fought in the wars, like elves, dwarves and humans were also deeply hurt and needed to
                rebuild. The century-long influence of the demons and elementals in this word however left their marks.
                In the south a mixed race of humans and demons developed, the Tieflings. In the north, the Genasi,
                elemental humanoids were the reminders of the wars. The orcs, no longer enslaved by Iseria, shook free
                of their former masters and founded a new home in the north east, a country called Karagon. They never
                truly recovered from this influence though and so orcs (and to a lesser degree half-orcs) are still
                heavily affected by the element of water or ice. The dwarves, being nearly completely driven out of
                their ‘Way of the Depths’ tried to rebuild the underground cities, but the damage was done. Elementals
                and other wild and magical creatures infested the deep roads and made it impossible to reconquer the
                underground. The thirteen heroes were celebrated from there on out as the saviours of the world and
                became risen gods in the following centuries after their deaths. They were called the new gods, each
                embodying certain abilities and traits. The world was divided into five kingdoms. Dornoth, the Cascian
                Empire, Karogon, Vultai and Iseria. The fourth age lasts until now and no historian made any claims that
                the age is over or a new age is in sight.
